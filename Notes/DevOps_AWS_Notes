In AWS 
key stores are two types 1. public and 2.private key stores
firewall is nothing but security group in aws.
in security group we need to all the traffice 
 1. inbound traffic = incomining traffic
 in inbound traffic we allow all  and next we add ssh secured socket shell. and ssh port is 22 and then we add my laptop in aws console
 2. outbount traffic= outgoing traffic (eg after entering home ppl may go back in coming way)

coding : Java, .net 

scripting : shell, python, ansible


In any language main concepts are 
1.variables
2.datatypes
3.functions
4.conditions
5.loops


 GIT

staging 

git add <file name>

git commit -m "i am practicing git>

git push origin main

git status    ---> to check the status 

 single command to git add, git commit, and git push 
 ==> git add . ; git commit -m "I am practicing  git ; git push origin main


shell script :

to check the syntax of our shell script, we need to give the location of bash
#!/bin/bash  ---> shebang
shell script = bash script

1.Variables
x=1, y=2, z=3
we derive formula and finally we submit values..

DRY = Dont repeat yourself

syntax 
VARIABLE_NAME=VALUE

person1=madhan
person2=Kethu

we shoudnt give spaces for variables is equal to value daggara
not like below
PERSON1 = madhan
PERSON2 = Kethana

it should be like below without spaces

PRESON1=madhan
PERSON2=Kethana

usually give variable name in Captial letters but not its mandatory.

change in a single location will effect everywhere automatically

how do you run command in shell script and take output

$(<command>)

$(date)
$(cal)

that value we need to take it as variable
DATE=$(date)

#!/bin/bash
DATE=$(date)
echo "date and time is $DATE"

#!/bin/bash
DATE=$(date)
CAL=$(cal)
HOSTNAME=$(hostName)

DISKFREE=$(df -hT)


echo "script started executing $DATE"


echo "this month calander $CAL"

echo " hostname = $HOSTNAME"

echo "diskfree $DISKFREE"

we have concept called arguments

arguments = args

#arguments=args we can pass values through command,args will be in every programming language and also in every scripting language.
#while running shellscripts we can pass arguments
#command without arguments -->sh 05-variables_arguments\=args.sh  without values
# command with arguments -->sh 05-variables_arguments\=args.sh JaySriRam sita


PERSON1=$1
PERSON2=$2

echo "$PERSON1: Hello $PERSON2, Good Morning "
echo "$PERSON2: Hi $PERSON1 , Very Good Morning"
echo "$PERSON1: How are you $PERSON2?"
echo "$PERSON2: I am good $PERSON1, How are you"

To connect to any external system we need to give username and password

#!/bin/bash
USERNAME=$1
PASSWORD=$2

echo "username is $USERNAME, password is:$PASSWORD"


password should be hide always

so we use read command 
==>read --help command will dispay option abou read
#!/bin/bash
echo "please enter the username"
read USERNAME #THE VALUE ENTRES WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY ATTACHED TO USERNAME
PASSWORD=$2

echo "username is $USERNAME, password is:$PASSWORD"


we use only read -s for not displaying username and password


data types:in shell script data types are not that much important, everything shell script take care chesthundhi
------------

Arrays:insted of storing one variable multiple values store chayadum అన్నమాట we can retive when we want. Like 

FRUITS=("Apple" "Banana" "Mango") 

 Echo "First value: ${FRUITS[0]}"
Echo" second value: ${FRUITS[1]}"
Echo" third value: ${FRUITS[2]}"

If we need all fruits we use @ as shown below 

Echo"all fruits: ${FRUITS [@]}"
================================
Conditions: program lo Kani script lo gani any Desi ion thesukovalsinappdu we need to use conditions

If (expression) {. }
